# 🚀 Razorpay Auto-Capture Implementation Guide

## ✅ **Auto-Capture Successfully Implemented**

Your Razorpay payment gateway now automatically captures payments immediately upon successful transaction!

---

## 🎯 **What is Auto-Capture?**

**Auto-Capture** means that when a customer makes a successful payment:
1. ✅ **Payment is authorized** by the bank
2. ✅ **Money is immediately captured** (transferred to your account)
3. ✅ **No manual capture required** - fully automated
4. ✅ **Instant confirmation** for customers

### **Before Auto-Capture:**
```
Payment Flow: Authorization → Manual Capture → Settlement
Timeline: Immediate → Manual Action → 1-2 days
```

### **With Auto-Capture:**
```
Payment Flow: Authorization → Auto-Capture → Settlement  
Timeline: Immediate → Immediate → 1-2 days
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **1. Order Creation with Auto-Capture**
```javascript
const orderData = {
  amount: plan.amount,
  currency: 'INR',
  payment_capture: 1, // ✅ Auto-capture enabled
  receipt: `receipt_${Date.now()}_${planId}`,
  notes: {
    plan_id: planId,
    auto_capture: 'enabled'
  }
};
```

### **2. Checkout Configuration**
```javascript
const rzpOptions = {
  key: this.razorpayKeyId,
  amount: options.amount,
  payment_capture: 1, // ✅ Auto-capture at checkout level
  handler: (response) => {
    // Payment automatically captured!
    console.log('Payment auto-captured:', response);
  }
};
```

### **3. Enhanced Success Handling**
```javascript
handler: (response) => {
  console.log('Payment successful (auto-captured):', response);
  // Payment is already captured - no manual action needed
  this.verifyPayment(response).then((result) => {
    // result.payment_status === 'captured'
    // result.auto_captured === true
  });
}
```
